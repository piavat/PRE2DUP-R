#' Calculates the most common duration between purchases
#'
#' Calculates the mode of time intervals between purchases for each package.
#' Intervals within 2 days are grouped together.
#' The most common (modal) interval is selected from the grouped values.
#' If multiple modes exist, the one closest to the median is chosen;
#' if there's still a tie, the one closest to the mean is selected.
#' Intended for internal use in the PRE2DUP-R package.
#'
#' @param pack_id vector of package identifiers
#' @param pre_ratio vector of package ratios, i.e. number of packages because partial packages are not allowed
#' @param dur vector of times between purchases
#'
#' @returns data.table with the most common duration between purchases
#'
#' @keywords internal
#' @importFrom stats median
