# PRE2DUP-R
A program to create treatment periods from drug purchases data

**Challenge in pharmacoepidemiologic studies: how to determine drug use periods from drug dispensing records**

Register-based drug dispensing data stored in various databases such as Medicaid and Nordic nationwide registers are widely used in pharmacoepidemiological studies. Valid methods for evaluating the drug use periods from dispensing data are needed for e.g. studies to investigate the association between drug exposure and health-related outcomes such as hospitalizations or death. 

## PRE2DUP method
The PRE2DUP (From prescription drug purchases to drug use periods) method is a novel approach based on mathematical modelling of personal drug purchasing behaviors. The method uses a decision procedure that utilizes the purchased amount in Defined Daily Doses (DDDs, defined by World Health Organization, WHO) and each person’s purchase history for constructing exposure time periods and dose estimates for each drug (defined as Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] codes). The method takes account of stockpiling of drugs, regularity of the purchases, and periods of hospital or nursing home care when drug use is not recorded in the databases of outpatient medication use. The method can be applied to virtually all drug classes and drug formulations.  Clinically meaningful estimates are ensured by expert-defined parameters for each drug package which control joining of purchases. These parameters define e.g. the lowest clinically meaningful dose for each drug package (characterized by drug substance, specifics of the drug formulation, strength and the number of units). The method also has features which tailor drug use periods for an individual and for the study population, based on data on individual purchase regularity and most common patterns of drug use in the studied population. 


## PRE2DUP-R
There is a growing demand for open-source version of PRE2DUP in the programming language and software familiar in the research field. R-package PRE2DUP-R provides an advanced tool for generating reliable drug use estimates from large dispensing databases and practical tools for data pre-processing and cleaning. It will form the basis for development of sub-programs for specific tasks which may be required in particular research fields.

Method has been validated with self-reported drug use, with expert-opinion based evaluation and with postmortem toxicological findings:
